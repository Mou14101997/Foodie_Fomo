Here we will be discussing an End-to-End Machine Learning Case Study on Zomato Restaurant Dataset . Descriptive Analytics and Predicting Rating for each restaurant depends on its facilities and features that each restaurant provides. The overall rating on Zomato for a restaurant is not the average rating given by the customers. The rating is relative to other restaurants in the same city. Zomato has many algorithms to determine the final rating which can change with performance of other restaurants nearby as well. The final ratings all the restaurants of a city are placed on a normal curve. In this project we predicted the ratings of restaurants of Bangalore.
